# NoteTaker

## A Notes App that allows you to write down notes and keep them in an organized app.

This app is designed to allow a user to take notes and keep them organized and readily available in an easy and intuative application.

- I created this app to help myself keep track of daily tasks that I need to complete.
- This app makes it easier for me to stay organized and see what goald I have left to complete at any given time.
- The app allows me to take notes and keep them visible on my desktop to refrence when I am ready to move onto a new task.
- While building this app I learned how to develop an express server enviornement and how to deploy an app on Heroku.
